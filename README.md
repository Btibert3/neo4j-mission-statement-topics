# About
Prismatic opened an API to classify an article with topics.  So many use cases, but what about:

__Student Search Company__
- Run Search where visually build emails (like mailchimp) and put into campaign
- can manually specifiy order or use built in testing/optimization
- build interests for students that are clicking on content  
- recommend content to optmize interers

__ - OR - __

- Build a web service to generate personlized recommendations
- Help schools with tracking code
- give me access to help setup/track with ga
- provide a service to generate recommendations / customized emails
